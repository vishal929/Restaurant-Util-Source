# Restaurant-Utility
Planning source code in java to eventually be implemented in an Android app as a service utility for restaurants. The idea is to familiarize myself network implemented applications. If there is demand, I will try to make an IOS version with swift.
## Idea of the Project
My idea is to help restaurant owners/managers better manage their restaurant while learning concepts for myself. My idea is to better integrate wait staff and kitchen staff and provide performance info that managers want. Managers can split their restaurant into different "operation zones" and monitor performance in those zones seperately, and get a cumulative performance breakdown for the entire business. In addition, this app will try to reduce "waste-time" by minimizing travel time for waiters to the console/kitchen, so waiters can focus on meeting customer's needs. 
## Who Can Benefit From This?
Based on my idea, I do not think this will help very small restaurants much. I see this utility being of use to medium to large institutions, who can benefit from reducing waiter 
waste-time" and a breakdown of individual portions of their restaurant.
